# stefanvermaas.com

This is the source for my personal website, [stefanvermaas.com](https://www.stefanvermaas.com). It is built with [Bridgetown](http://www.bridgetownrb.com), a static site generator. It is automatically deployed to and hosted on a VPS at [TransIP](https://www.transip.nl).

## Getting started

To run and built the site locally, you'll need to have Ruby and NodeJS installed. To install Ruby, I recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation). To install NodeJS, I recommend using [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation).

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it.
2. Run `bundle` to install Ruby dependencies.
3. Run `yarn` to install the Javascript dependencies.
4. Run `bundle exec bridgetown start` to build the site and serve it locally.
5. Browse to http://localhost:4000.
