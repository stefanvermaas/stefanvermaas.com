# stefanvermaas.com

This is the source for my personal website, [stefanvermaas.com](https://www.stefanvermaas.com). It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a static site generator. It is automatically deployed to and hosted on a VPS at [TransIP](https://www.transip.nl).

## Getting started

To run and build the site locally, you'll need to have Node.js installed. To install Node.js, I recommend using [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation).

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to build the site and serve it locally.
4. Browse to http://localhost:4321.

## License

This is my personal site. I'm keeping its source code open, but this is not a template. You're free to re-use parts of this codebase in your own site, with attribution. Just don't copy the entire thing, replace the content and publish it. You know - be nice about it.
